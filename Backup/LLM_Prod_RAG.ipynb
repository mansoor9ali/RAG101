    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline from scratch and have it run on a local GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'd like to be able to open a PDF file, ask questions (queries) of it and have them answered by a Large Language Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are frameworks that replicate this kind of workflow, including [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) and [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), however, the goal of building from scratch is to be able to inspect and customize all the parts."

    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was introduced in the paper [*Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step can be roughly broken down to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Seeking relevant information from a source given a query. For example, getting relevant passages of Wikipedia text from a database given a question.\n",
    "* **Augmented** - Using the relevant retrieved information to modify an input to a generative model (e.g. an LLM).\n",
    "* **Generation** - Generating an output given an input. For example, in the case of an LLM, generating a passage of text given an input prompt."

    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outptus of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two primary improvements can be seen as:\n",
    "1. **Preventing hallucinations** - LLMs are incredible but they are prone to potential hallucination, as in, generating something that *looks* correct but isn't. RAG pipelines can help LLMs generate more factual outputs by providing them with factual (retrieved) inputs. And even if the generated answer from a RAG pipeline doesn't seem correct, because of retrieval, you also have access to the sources where it came from.\n",
    "2. **Work with custom data** - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale text data. This means they have a great ability to model language, however, they often lack specific knowledge. RAG systems can provide LLMs with domain-specific data such as medical information or company documentation and thus customized their outputs to suit specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the original RAG paper mentioned above outlined these two points in their discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This work offers several positive societal benefits over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
    "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
    "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
    "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it\n",
    "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
    "effective at their jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can also be a much quicker solution to implement than fine-tuning an LLM on specific data.\n"

    "## What kind of problems can RAG be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can help anywhere there is a specific set of information that an LLM may not have in its training data (e.g. anything not publicly accessible on the internet).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you could use RAG for:\n",
    "* **Customer support Q&A chat** - By treating your existing customer support documentation as a resource, when a customer asks a question, you could have a system retrieve relevant documentation snippets and then have an LLM craft those snippets into an answer. Think of this as a \"chatbot for your documentation\". Klarna, a large financial company, [uses a system like this](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/) to save $40M per year on customer support costs.\n",
    "* **Email chain analysis** - Let's say you're an insurance company with long threads of emails between customers and insurance agents. Instead of searching through each individual email, you could retrieve relevant passages and have an LLM create strucutred outputs of insurance claims.\n",
    "* **Company internal documentation chat** - If you've worked at a large company, you know how hard it can be to get an answer sometimes. Why not let a RAG system index your company information and have an LLM answer questions you may have? The benefit of RAG is that you will have references to resources to learn more if the LLM answer doesn't suffice.\n",
    "* **Textbook Q&A** - Let's say you're studying for your exams and constantly flicking through a large textbook looking for answers to your quesitons. RAG can help provide answers as well as references to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these have the common theme of retrieving relevant resources and then presenting them in an understandable way using an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this angle, you can consider an LLM a calculator for words.\n"

    "\n",
    "Privacy, speed, cost.\n",

    "From a privacy standpoint, this means you don't have send potentially sensitive data to an API.\n",

    "From a speed standpoint, it means you won't necessarily have to wait for an API queue or downtime, if your hardware is running, the pipeline can run.\n",

    "## Key terms\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | Description |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| **Token** | A sub-word piece of text. For example, \"hello, world!\" could be split into [\"hello\", \",\", \"world\", \"!\"]. A token can be a whole word,<br> part of a word or group of punctuation characters. 1 token ~= 4 characters in English, 100 tokens ~= 75 words.<br> Text gets broken into tokens before being passed to an LLM. |\n",
    "| **Embedding** | A learned numerical representation of a piece of data. For example, a sentence of text could be represented by a vector with<br> 768 values. Similar pieces of text (in meaning) will ideally have similar values. |\n",
    "| **Embedding model** | A model designed to accept input data and output a numerical representation. For example, a text embedding model may take in 384 <br>tokens of text and turn it into a vector of size 768. An embedding model can and often is different to an LLM model. |\n",
    "| **Similarity search/vector search** | Similarity search/vector search aims to find two vectors which are close together in high-demensional space. For example, <br>two pieces of similar text passed through an embedding model should have a high similarity score, whereas two pieces of text about<br> different topics will have a lower similarity score. Common similarity score measures are dot product and cosine similarity. |\n",
    "| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A model which has been trained to numerically represent the patterns in text. A generative LLM will continue a sequence when given a sequence. <br>For example, given a sequence of the text \"hello, world!\", a genertive LLM may produce \"we're going to build a RAG pipeline today!\".<br> This generation will be highly dependant on the training data and prompt. |\n",
    "| **LLM context window** | The number of tokens a LLM can accept as input. For example, as of March 2024, GPT-4 has a default context window of 32k tokens<br> (about 96 pages of text) but can go up to 128k if needed. A recent open-source LLM from Google, Gemma (March 2024) has a context<br> window of 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages of text). A higher context window means an LLM can accept more relevant information<br> to assist with a query. For example, in a RAG pipeline, if a model has a larger context window, it can accept more reference items<br> from the retrieval system to aid with its generation. |\n",
    "| **Prompt** | A common term for describing the input to a generative LLM. The idea of \"[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)\" is to structure a text-based<br> (or potentially image-based as well) input to a generative LLM in a specific way so that the generated output is ideal. This technique is<br> possible because of a LLMs capacity for in-context learning, as in, it is able to use its representation of language to breakdown <br>the prompt and recognize what a suitable output may be (note: the output of LLMs is probable, so terms like \"may output\" are used). |\n",

Early childhood encompasses infancy and the toddler years, from  birth through age three. The remaining part of childhood is the  period from ages four through eight and is the time when children  enter school. A number of critical physiological and emotional  changes take place during the life stage from childhood through  adolescences. Children’s attitudes and opinions about food deepen.  They not only begin taking their cues about food preferences from  family members, but also from peers and the larger culture. In  Hawai‘i, organizations such as the Kōkua Hawai‘i Foundation have  implemented school programs such as ‘Āina In Schools to connect  children to their local land, waters, and food. The program initiative  is to address childhood health issues by fostering healthy eating  habits by teaching and engaging youth about local and traditional  foods.1  Parents also greatly impact their child’s nutritional choices. This  time in a child’s life provides an opportunity for parents and other  caregivers to reinforce good eating habits and to introduce new  foods into the diet, while remaining mindful of a child’s preferences.  Parents should also serve as role models for their children, who will  1.\\xa0About ‘Āina In Schools. Kōkua Hawai‘i Foundation.  https://www.kokuahawaiifoundation.org/aina.

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

    "On average each of our pages has 10 sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "And an average total of 287 tokens per page.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our groups of 10 sentences will also be ~287 tokens long.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us plenty of room for the text to embedded by our `all-mpnet-base-v2` model (it has a capacity of 384 tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "To split our groups of sentences into chunks of 10 or less, let's create a function which accepts a list as input and recursively breaks into down into sublists of a specified size."

Some scientists hypothesize that high-protein diets may accelerate bone-tissue loss because under some conditions the acids in protein block absorption of calcium in the gut, and, once in the blood, amino acids promote calcium loss from bone; however even these effects have not been consistently observed in scientific studies. Results from the Nurses’ Health Study suggest that women who eat more than 95 grams of protein each day have a 20 percent higher risk for wrist fracture.23 Other studies have not produced consistent results. The scientific data on high protein diets and increased risk for osteoporosis remains highly controversial and more research is needed to come to any conclusions about the association between the two.4 http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020456.

    "### Embedding our text chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "While humans understand text, machines understand numbers best.\n",
    "\n",
    "An [embedding](https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/index.html) is a broad concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "But one of my favourite and simple definitions is \"a useful numerical representation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The most powerful thing about modern embeddings is that they are *learned* representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning rather than directly mapping words/tokens/characters to numbers directly (e.g. `{\"a\": 0, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 3...}`), the numerical representation of tokens is learned by going through large corpuses of text and figuring out how different tokens relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, embeddings of text will mean that similar meaning texts have similar numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Most modern NLP models deal with \"tokens\" which can be considered as multiple different sizes and combinations of words and characters rather than always whole words or single characters. For example, the string `\"hello world!\"` gets mapped to the token values `{15339: b'hello', 1917: b' world', 0: b'!'}` using [Byte pair encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) (or BPE via OpenAI's [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library). Google has a tokenization library called [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to turn each of our chunks into a numerical representation (an embedding vector, where a vector is a sequence of numbers arranged in order).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our text samples are in embedding vectors, us humans will no longer be able to understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we don't need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding vectors are for our computers to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use our computers to find patterns in the embeddings and then we can use their text mappings to further our understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough talking, how about we import a text embedding model and see what an embedding looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we'll use the [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/installation.html) library which contains many pre-trained embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'll get the `all-mpnet-base-v2` model (you can see the model's intended use on the [Hugging Face model card](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2#intended-uses))."

Therefore, reversing or improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight, losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble exterior.\",\n          \"Image by\\u00a0Gtirouflet / CC BY-SA 3.0 dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk, sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 \\u201cCortical (Compact) Bone\\u201d).

    "### Chunking and embedding questions\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Which embedding model should I use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This depends on many factors. My best advice is to experiment, experiment, experiment!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the model to run locally, you'll have to make sure it's feasible to run on your own hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to see how different models perform on a wide range of embedding tasks is the [Hugging Face Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What other forms of text chunking/splitting are there?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a fair few options here too. We've kept it simple with groups of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more, [Pinecone has a great guide on different kinds of chunking](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/) including for different kinds of data such as markdown and LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries such as [LangChain also have a good amount of in-built text splitting options](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What should I think about when creating my embeddings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model turns text inputs up to 384 tokens long in embedding vectors of size 768.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the larger the vector size, the more information that gets encoded into the embedding (however, this is not always the case, as smaller, better models can outperform larger ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though with larger vector sizes comes larger storage and compute requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is also relatively small (420MB) in size compared to larger models that are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger models may result in better performance but will also require more compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "So some things to think about:\n",

    "## 2. RAG - Search and Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed RAG briefly in the beginning but let's quickly recap.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is another way of saying \"given a query, search for relevant resources and answer based on those resources\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's breakdown each step:\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Get relevant resources given a query. For example, if the query is \"what are the macronutrients?\" the ideal results will contain information about protein, carbohydrates and fats (and possibly alcohol) rather than information about which tractors are the best for farming (though that is also cool information).\n",
    "* **Augmentation** - LLMs are capable of generating text given a prompt. However, this generated text is designed to *look* right. And it often has some correct information, however, they are prone to hallucination (generating a result that *looks* like legit text but is factually wrong). In augmentation, we pass relevant information into the prompt and get an LLM to use that relevant information as the basis of its generation.\n",
    "* **Generation** - This is where the LLM will generate a response that has been flavoured/augmented with the retrieved resources. In turn, this not only gives us a potentially more correct answer, it also gives us resources to investigate more (since we know which resources went into the prompt).\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole idea of RAG is to get an LLM to be more factually correct based on your own input as well as have a reference to where the generated output may have come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an incredibly helpful tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you had 1000s of customer support documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use RAG to generate direct answers to questions with links to relevant documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you were an insurance company with large chains of claims emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use RAG to answer questions about the emails with sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "One helpful analogy is to think of LLMs as calculators for words.\n",
    "\n",
    "With good inputs, the LLM can sort them into helpful outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How?\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts with better search."

    "\n",
    "Perhaps searching via *meaning* is a better analogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "With keyword search, you are trying to match the string \"apple\" with the string \"apple\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas with similarity/semantic search, you may want to search \"macronutrients functions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And get back results that don't necessarily contain the words \"macronutrients functions\" but get back pieces of text that match that meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:** Using similarity search on our textbook data with the query \"macronutrients function\" returns a paragraph that starts with:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">*There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions.*\n",

Therefore, reversing or improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight, losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble exterior.\",\n          \"Image by\\u00a0Gtirouflet / CC BY-SA 3.0 dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk, sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 \\u201cCortical (Compact) Bone\\u201d).

    "### Similarity measures: dot product and cosine similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk similarity measures between vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, embedding vectors which are representations of data with magnitude and direction in high dimensional space (our embedding vectors have 768 dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most common you'll across are the dot product and cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are quite similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that cosine similarity has a normalization step.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Similarity measure | Description | Code |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| [Dot Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) | - Measure of magnitude and direction between two vectors<br>- Vectors that are aligned in direction and magnitude have a higher positive value<br>- Vectors that are opposite in direction and magnitude have a higher negative value | [`torch.dot`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.dot.html), [`np.dot`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html), [`sentence_transformers.util.dot_score`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/util.html#sentence_transformers.util.dot_score) |\n",
    "| [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) | - Vectors get normalized by magnitude/[Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics))/L2 norm so they have unit length and are compared more so on direction<br>- Vectors that are aligned in direction have a value close to 1<br>- Vectors that are opposite in direction have a value close to -1 | [`torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity.html), [`1 - scipy.spatial.distance.cosine`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cosine.html) (subtract the distance from 1 for similarity measure), [`sentence_transformers.util.cos_sim`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/util.html#sentence_transformers.util.cos_sim) |\n",
    "\n",
    "For text similarity, you generally want to use cosine similarity as you are after the semantic measurements (direction) rather than magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, our embedding model `all-mpnet-base-v2` outputs normalized outputs (see the [Hugging Face model card](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2#usage-huggingface-transformers) for more on this) so dot product and cosine similarity return the same results. However, dot product is faster due to not need to perform a normalize step.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things bit more concrete, let's make simple dot product and cosine similarity functions and view their results on different vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Similarity measures between vectors and embeddings can be used on any kind of embeddings, not just text embeddings. For example, you could measure image embedding similarity or audio embedding similarity. Or with text and image models like [CLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip), you can measure the similarity between text and image embeddings."

    "Alright! Looks like `gemma-7b-it` it is (for my local machine with an RTX 4090, change the `model_id` and `use_quantization_config` values to suit your needs)!\n",

    "There are plenty of examples of how to load the model on the `gemma-7b-it` [Hugging Face model card](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news is, the Hugging Face [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/) library has all the tools we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "To load our LLM, we're going to need a few things:\n",
    "1. A quantization config (optional) - This will determine whether or not we load the model in 4bit precision for lower memory usage. The we can create this with the [`transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.38.2/en/main_classes/quantization#transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig) class (requires installing the [`bitsandbytes` library](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)).\n",
    "2. A model ID - This is the reference Hugging Face model ID which will determine which tokenizer and model gets used. For example `gemma-7b-it`.\n",
    "3. A tokenzier - This is what will turn our raw text into tokens ready for the model. We can create it using the [`transformers.AutoTokenzier.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.38.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) method and passing it our model ID.\n",
    "4. An LLM model - Again, using our model ID we can load a specific LLM model. To do so we can use the [`transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained) method and passing it our model ID as well as other various parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus, we'll check if [Flash Attention 2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_infer_gpu_one#flashattention-2) is available using `transformers.utils.is_flash_attn_2_available()`. Flash Attention 2 speeds up the attention mechanism in Transformer architecture models (which is what many modern LLMs are based on, including Gemma). So if it's available and the model is supported (not all models support Flash Attention 2), we'll use it. If it's not available, you can install it by following the instructions on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Flash Attention 2 currently works on NVIDIA GPUs with a compute capability score of 8.0+ (Ampere, Ada Lovelace, Hopper architectures). We can check our GPU compute capability score with [`torch.cuda.get_device_capability(0)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cuda.get_device_capability.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** To get access to the Gemma models, you will have to [agree to the terms & conditions](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it) on the Gemma model page on Hugging Face. You will then have to authorize your local machine via the [Hugging Face CLI/Hugging Face Hub `login()` function](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/quick-start#authentication). Once you've done this, you'll be able to download the models. If you're using Google Colab, you can add a [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to the \"Secrets\" tab.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Downloading an LLM locally can take a fair bit of time depending on your internet connection. Gemma 7B is about a 16GB download and Gemma 2B is about a 6GB download.\n",

    "We can generate text with our LLM `model` instance by calling the [`generate()` method](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.38.2/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationConfig) (this method has plenty of options to pass into it alongside the text) on it and passing it a tokenized input.\n",

    "The tokenized input comes from passing a string of text to our `tokenizer`.\n",

    "It's important to note that you should use a tokenizer that has been paired with a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise if you try to use a different tokenizer and then pass those inputs to a model, you will likely get errors/strange results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some LLMs, there's a specific template you should pass to them for ideal outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `gemma-7b-it` model has been trained in a dialogue fashion (instruction tuning).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our `tokenizer` has a [`apply_chat_template()` method](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.apply_chat_template) which can prepare our input text in the right format for the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The following demo has been modified from the Hugging Face model card for [Gemma 7B](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it). Many similar demos of usage are available on the model cards of similar models."

    "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.

    "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",

Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke.

      "- milk is the best source to fulfill nutritional requirements. An exclusively breastfed infant does not even need extra water, including in hot climates. A newborn infant (birth to 28 days) requires feedings eight to twelve times a day or more. Between 1 and 3 months of age, the breastfed infant becomes more efficient, and the number of feedings per day often become fewer even though the amount of milk consumed stays the same. After about six months, infants can gradually begin to consume solid foods to help meet nutrient needs. Foods that are added in addition to breastmilk are called complementary foods. Complementary foods should be nutrient dense to provide optimal nutrition. Complementary foods include baby meats, vegetables, fruits, infant cereal, and dairy products such as yogurt, but not infant formula. Infant formula is a substitute, not a complement to breastmilk. In addition to complementary foods, the World Health Organization recommends that breastfeeding continue up to 2 years of age or beyond, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends at least one year of breastfeeding, or longer.\n",
      "- Most mothers can make enough milk for their babies whether they have small or large breasts. It is normal for a woman to have one breast that is different than the other in size or shape. During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in size. If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during pregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or a lactation consultant. After the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to ensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy into childhood. Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for rapid growth and development. As a result, the WHO recommends that breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first six months of an infant’s life. Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the best ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health of her infant child. Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients that a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy life. Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over 80% of women start to breastfeed their infants.\n",

To learn more about Hawai‘i’s laws visit http://health.hawaii.gov/wic/files/2013/04/ WorkplaceBreastfeeding_02_2014.pdf and for Guam’s laws visit  http://www.guamcourts.org/CompilerofLaws/GCA/ 10gca/10gc092A.pdf. Members of a community can also promote and support breastfeeding. New mothers can join peer counseling groups or turn to other women within their community who have previous experience with breastfeeding. In addition, community-based programs can provide education and support. The US Department of Agriculture’s Women, Infants, and Children program provides information on breastfeeding and both professional and peer support for women and their babies from low-income families. Launched in 2004, the Loving Support program combines peer counseling with breastfeeding promotion efforts to increase 7. Hawaiʻi State Judiciary. (2020).\n",
      "- is making sure that children receive an adequate amount of needed nutrients to provide a strong foundation for the rest of their lives. Most expectant mothers begin thinking about how they will feed their baby early in their pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to offer breastfeeding education and support starting with the first prenatal appointment.  Support from family members, especially the baby’s father and grandmother, plus friends, employers, and others can greatly help with both the decision-making process during pregnancy and the beginning and maintenance of breastfeeding after the baby’s birth. In the United States, about 83.2 percent of babies start out being breastfed.1 Yet by the age of six months, when solid foods should begin to be introduced into a child’s diet along with breast milk, only about 25 percent of infants in the United States were still breastfed exclusively, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2 The approval and assistance of family members, friends, employers, health-care providers, and policymakers can make an enormous difference and provide the needed promotion and support for mothers who wish to breastfeed their children. Education about breastfeeding typically begins with health-care providers. During prenatal care and often soon after a woman has given birth, doctors, nurses, and other clinicians can explain the benefits of breastfeeding and describe the proper technique. Nearly all births in the United States and Canada occur in hospital settings, and hospital practices in labor, delivery, postpartum care, and discharge planning can inform and support women who want to 1. U.

      "- caloric content in breast milk is made up of fat. A high-fat diet that includes cholesterol is necessary to support the development of neural pathways in the brain and throughout the body. However, saturated fats and trans fatty acids inhibit this growth. Infants who are over the age of six months, which means they are receiving complementary foods, should not consume foods that are high in these types of fats. The RDA (AI) for total fat is 30 grams per day for infants 0-6 months old and 31 grams per day for infants 7-12 months old. Micronutrients Almost all of the nutrients that infants require during the first 6 months can be met if they consume an adequate amount of breast milk. There are a few exceptions, though. Unless the mother is taking a large dose of Vitamin D, human milk will be low in vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption and building bone, among other things. Therefore, breastfed children often need to take a vitamin D supplement in the form of drops. Infants at the highest risk for vitamin D deficiency are those with darker skin and little to no exposure to sunlight, and infants born prematurely.. The context contains the answer.

A newborn infant (birth to 28 days) requires feedings eight to twelve times a day or more. Between 1 and 3 months of age, the breastfed infant becomes more efficient, and the number of feedings per day often become fewer even though the amount of milk consumed stays the same. After about six months, infants can gradually begin to consume solid foods to help meet nutrient needs. Foods that are added in addition to breastmilk are called complementary foods. Complementary foods should be nutrient dense to provide optimal nutrition. Complementary foods include baby meats, vegetables, fruits, infant cereal, and dairy products such as yogurt, but not infant formula. Infant formula is a substitute, not a complement to breastmilk. In addition to complementary foods, the World Health Organization recommends that breastfeeding continue up to 2 years of age or beyond, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends at least one year of breastfeeding, or longer.',\n",

It is normal for a woman to have one breast that is different than the other in size or shape. During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in size. If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during pregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or a lactation consultant. After the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to ensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy into childhood. Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for rapid growth and development. As a result, the WHO recommends that breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first six months of an infant’s life. Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the best ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health of her infant child. Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients that a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy life. Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over 80% of women start to breastfeed their infants.',\n",

A high-fat diet that includes cholesterol is necessary to support the development of neural pathways in the brain and throughout the body. However, saturated fats and trans fatty acids inhibit this growth. Infants who are over the age of six months, which means they are receiving complementary foods, should not consume foods that are high in these types of fats. The RDA (AI) for total fat is 30 grams per day for infants 0-6 months old and 31 grams per day for infants 7-12 months old. Micronutrients Almost all of the nutrients that infants require during the first 6 months can be met if they consume an adequate amount of breast milk. There are a few exceptions, though. Unless the mother is taking a large dose of Vitamin D, human milk will be low in vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption and building bone, among other things. Therefore, breastfed children often need to take a vitamin D supplement in the form of drops. Infants at the highest risk for vitamin D deficiency are those with darker skin and little to no exposure to sunlight, and infants born prematurely.',\n",
